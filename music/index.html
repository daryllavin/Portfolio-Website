            Throughout my time in high school, I was a very active member of the musical community. I was the low brass section leader and drum major in my high school band, and played first chair in both the regional honors concert band and jazz band. Additionally, I played in the CT All State Band twice, and was first trombonist in the All Eastern and All National Symphony Orchestras. <br /><br /> I also have been an active performer around the southwestern CT area. I played in the Western CT Youth Orchestra and Norwalk Youth Symphony, for which I was awarded a full-tuition scholarship, and am an active member of the New Canaan Town Community Band to this day, playing town events including fireworks, christmas carols, and more. <br /><br />
            I am now located in Pittsburgh during the academic year where I am in the CMU Trombone Studio. I play in the brass ensemble as well as with the CMU Philharmonic and Wind Ensemble. I'm always excited to play wherever and whenever I can, so feel free to reach out!

              I first chose to play the trombone in 5th grade when I thought it would be the funniest instrument to play in band class.

              I started taking trombone lessons and was accepted to the Western CT Regional Honors band as a 6th grader. I would end up doing so every year from then through the end of high school.
